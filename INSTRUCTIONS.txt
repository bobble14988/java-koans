Academy 7 Koans Problems

 o <project>\src\main\java\com.ten10.training
    - These will be the components you are testing, you can consider these part of your SUT.
 o <project>\src\main\java\com.ten10.tests
    - These will be your tests.

Instructions:
    - No tests will pass when you first open the project. Your job is to get as many to
      pass as possible in the time allotted.
    - The test scenario will be in a block comment above the test itself.
    - Before you make any changes, be sure you know what is causing the test to fail:
        > Is there a defect with the component you're testing?
        > Is there a issue with the test?
        > Is the test specification incorrect?
        > Hint: The failure messages are there to help you, try to use them.
    - Also keep your eyes out for any incomplete or non-existent tests/functionality - a giveaway is the flag TODO!

Extra activities for if you finish:
    - Are there any tests which you feel are missing? Why?
    - How would you enforce a strength range for Characters, rather than specifying an integer?
    - How could you assign superpowers to Characters? Hint: Look up the difference between a
      class and an interface. Which one would work better?
